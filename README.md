A quick little Rust app written to teach my kid to keep it down when he's gaming on voice chat.

Samples ambient audio on startup and then, if the microphone detects too loud a volume, the main Wi-Fi connection is cut for up to 3 seconds.
Just long enough to be *insanely annoying* and also absolutely hilarious.
